{{H1:Contribute}}

Want to contribute to slowmoVideo? The project is on GitHub:
: https://github.com/Granjow/slowmoVideo
The easiest way to start hacking is to fork the repository and to send a pull request so I can apply the changes.

slowmoVideo is using the Qt framework, so the easiest thing is to use the lightweight (starts quickly) but powerful [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_Creator Qt Creator] for development.
