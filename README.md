Building the web page
---------------------

This page runs with wiki2xhtml which creates HTML files from Wikitext. To run it, simply type

    make

and the web page will most likely be built (goes to the html/ subdirectory). If not, you might not be using a unix based system.
wiki2xhtml is also available [on git](git://wiki2xhtml.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/wiki2xhtml/wiki2xhtml).
