Building the web page
---------------------

This page runs with wiki2xhtml which creates HTML files from Wikitext. To run it, simply type

    make

and the web page will most likely be built (goes to the html/ subdirectory). If not, you might not be using a unix based system.
wiki2xhtml is also available [on git](git://wiki2xhtml.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/wiki2xhtml/wiki2xhtml).

Requirements:

* `rsync`
* `imagemagick`
* `java`

Alternatively, use the [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) (which builds `granjow/wiki2xhtml`)
which contains those dependencies.
