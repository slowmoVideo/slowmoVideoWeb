slowmoVideo requires $$ffmpeg$$ to run. The AppImage file for Linux first has
to be made executable with $$chmod u+x$$.

To run the AppImage file on Linux, you have to make it executable first with $$chmod u+x slowmoUI.AppImage$$.

Help for OS X and Windows builds is appreciated.


<!--
'''For Windows''' you additionally need to download ffmpeg from [http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ Zeranoe] ''(32-bit Builds (Static))'' and extract $$ffmpeg.exe$$ into the same directory as $$slowmoUI.exe$$. '''Please upgrade to 0.3.1''' as older versions do not work anymore with current ffmpeg versions.

'''On Linux,''' if slowmoVideo crashes in a file dialog with an error message like $$QSpiAccessible::accessibleEvent not handled$$, removing $$qt-at-spi$$ should fix the problem.


=== Mac OS X ===

There is no native port yet for OS X, but Wine or Crossover allow to run the Windows build:

# Download slowmoVideo for Windows and unzip it
# Download the ffmpeg Win32 static builds from [http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ Zeranoe] and place ffmpeg.exe in the same directory as $$slowmoUI.exe$$
# Install [http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/ Winebottler] or [http://www.codeweavers.com/products/crossover-mac/ Crossover] ($)
# Open slowmoVideo with Wine from Winebottler or with Crossover

Don’t forget to use control (Ctrl) instead of command (Cmd) for Undo and other operations.

slowmoVideo is not yet available on OS X since the author does not have a Mac. It should compile easily however. [[contribute.html Help is appreciated]] :)
